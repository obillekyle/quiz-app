/**
 * Enum members in the column diff.
 *
 * Changing an enum's members used to be a silent no-op: `_enum` was excluded
 * from the diff, so the schema said one thing and the database kept enforcing
 * another. It is in the diff now, gated on the ledger being the source of
 * "current".
 *
 * The gate is the whole design, and these assert both halves of it. Under
 * introspection the members cannot be compared: all three dialects report the
 * `CHECK` constraint back in a different shape, and Postgres re-renders it
 * entirely, so comparing there would differ every single time and rebuild the
 * table on every sync, forever. That is the failure the `length` note in
 * helpers.ts says it waited to rule out.
