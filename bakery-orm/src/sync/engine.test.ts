/**

 *
 * Measured against a real database before removing it, the special case:
 *   - dropped a rename in a table nothing else touched, leaving the sync to
 *     report a *perfect* sync while the column kept its old name: forever,
 *     since the next run re-derives and re-discards the same plan;
 *   - threw `Object.entries requires that input parameter not be null or
 *     undefined` when a table rename and an unrelated column rename coincided,
 *     because the table it added to `tablesToRebuild` is keyed by its *old*
 *     name and `constraints` has no such entry;
 *   - threw `NOT NULL constraint failed` when a rename and a rebuild landed on
 *     the same table, because the rebuild copies by *new* column name and the
 *     rename that would have produced it had just been discarded.
 *
 * The first two are pinned through `SyncEngine.run`, which is where it was
 * called from; the rest execute the plan and check the rows.
