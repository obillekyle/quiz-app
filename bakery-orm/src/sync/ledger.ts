/**
 * A record, inside the database, of the schema Bakery last applied to it.
 *
 * **Why this exists.** Sync has always compared your TypeScript schema against
 * live introspection, which means reconstructing *intent* from whatever the
 * dialect reports back. Nearly every sync bug this project has had is that
 * reconstruction going wrong: Postgres re-rendering `''` as
 * `''::character varying`, MySQL reporting `information_schema` columns
 * uppercase, `tinyint(1)` versus `data_type`, `EXTRACT` rewritten to
 * `date_part` on older servers, an empty-string default parsed into the number
 * zero. Each one produced a column that differed from itself forever, rebuilding
 * the table on every single sync.
 *
 * Comparing against what we *wrote down* removes that whole class. Two JSON
 * objects, no dialect spellings, no normalization, and it can carry things
 * introspection cannot report reliably, such as a `VARCHAR` width.
 *
 * **Why it is not simply trusted.** Introspection cannot lie about what exists;
 * a ledger can. If someone alters the database outside Bakery, the ledger is
 * stale, and migrating from a stale premise is worse than a spurious rebuild:
 * it can drop a column somebody added. So the ledger is used only when its
 * *shape* still matches the live database, and shape is checked by comparing
 * table and column names, which needs no normalization and therefore cannot
 * suffer the bugs above. Anything else falls back to introspection.
 *
 * One consequence to know: **MySQL commits DDL implicitly**, so the schema
 * change and the ledger write cannot be one atomic unit there. A crash between
 * them leaves the ledger behind, which the shape check then catches: it fails
 * safe, toward introspection.

 * dialect, so this check cannot itself be wrong in the way the others were.
 *
 * **But a name has two spellings, and the two sides do not use the same one.**
 * The ledger stores the keys of your TypeScript schema (whatever you passed to
 * `table()` / `view()`), while `getConstraints()` camelCases everything it reads
 * back. So a table declared `view('published_posts', …)` is `published_posts` in
 * the ledger and `publishedPosts` from introspection, and this check called that
 * a drifted database: *"tables differ (+publishedPosts; -published_posts)"*, on
 * a database nothing had touched. Permanently: the spellings never converge, so
 * every later sync re-reported it and the ledger was never used again. Every app
 * `bun create bakery` generated hit it on the first `db:sync`, because the
 * generated schema declares exactly that view.
 *
 * The damage is quieter than the warning. Falling back to introspection is
 * *safe*, so nothing breaks loudly: it just silently withdraws the thing the
 * ledger is for. Enum member changes, for one, only migrate when the diff runs
 * against the ledger (`plan.ledgerSource === 'ledger'`), so on any such app that
 * feature was inert.
 *
 * Comparing camel-normalized names fixes it at the one place the two spellings
 * meet. `LEDGER_ALIASES` below is the same bug, found earlier and patched for a
 * single known name; this is the general form of it.
