 * A view body is compared as text, so normalizing it is only safe if the result

 * the same string), and **idempotent**. Break either and the view is recreated
 * on every sync, forever.
 *
 * The fixture is the canonical form MySQL returns for a real aggregated view:
 * fully qualified, fully quoted, every column aliased to itself, JSON
 * aggregates and casts throughout. Verified against seven live views before
 * being written down here.
