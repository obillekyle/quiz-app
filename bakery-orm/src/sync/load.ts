/**
 * Where a project's data model lives, and how it is read.
 *
 * Two layouts are supported. `orm/` is the newer one: tables in `schema.ts`,
 * indexes in `indexes.ts`, foreign keys in `foreign.ts`, re-exported from
 * `orm/index.ts`. A single `schema.ts` at the root still works, so nothing
 * has to move.
 *
 * The folder is not only tidier: it separates what the generator owns from
 * what a person wrote. `--choose=db` regenerates tables; with everything in
 * one file it has to rewrite indexes and foreign keys too, and anything
 * hand-authored alongside them is collateral.
 *
 * Both of those are *defaults*, probed in that order from the app's cwd. An
 * app that keeps its model somewhere else (`db/`, `src/database/`, a path
 * shared with another tool) sets `schema` in `server.config.ts` and this
 * stops guessing:
 *
 * ```ts
 * export default defineConfig({ schema: 'db/orm' })   // folder layout
 * export default defineConfig({ schema: 'db/model.ts' }) // single file
 * ```
 *
 * A configured path is resolved against the app's cwd and is **not** a hint.
 * If it does not exist the load fails (`missing`) instead of quietly falling
 * back to the defaults: a typo in that one string would otherwise leave the
 * app running against no schema at all, and `--choose=db` would then generate
 * a fresh one at the typo'd path while the real model sits untouched
 * somewhere else.
