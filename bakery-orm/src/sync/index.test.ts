/**
 * `db:sync --help` used to be the *last* thing `run()` checked, after
 * `initConfig`, `initDB`, `loadSchema` and both fatal guards. So the one flag
 * whose job is to explain the others could not be reached on a database it
 * could not open or a schema it refused, and asking for help opened a
 * connection and created `bakery/server.db` as a side effect.
 *
 * Driven as a subprocess rather than by calling `run()` here: the ordering is
 * the whole point, and only a real process shows what was touched on the way.
 * It also keeps `core/init.ts`, which `sync/index.ts` imports for its side
 * effects, redefining `process.env` flags process-wide: out of the test runner.
 * Two spawns, reused across the assertions, because each costs a few seconds.
