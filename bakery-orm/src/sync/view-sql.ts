/**
 * Canonicalizing a view's `SELECT` so the two sides of the diff can be compared.
 *
 * A view body is compared as **text**: there is no parser here, and there will
 * not be one. That works only if both sides are spelled the same way, and they
 * are not: you write
 *
 *     SELECT id, name FROM users WHERE active = 1
 *
 * and MySQL hands back
 *
 *     select `p`.`id` AS `id`,`p`.`name` AS `name` from `buzzy`.`users` `p` ...
 *
 * fully qualified, fully quoted, with every alias spelled out. Compare those
 * literally and the view is recreated on every single sync, forever: the same
 * perpetual-churn failure the column diff has hit twice.
 *
 * So everything here must hold two properties, and both are tested:
 *
 * - **Idempotent**: `f(f(x)) === f(x)`.
 * - **Convergent**: `f(what you wrote) === f(what the server returns)`.
 *
 * Which is why this only removes *noise*: quoting, schema qualification,
 * redundant aliases, whitespace. It never reorders, rewrites or reflows
 * anything semantic, because a transformation the server would not also produce
 * is one that makes the two sides differ rather than agree.
 */

 * Words that must keep their quoting: unquoting one turns an identifier into
