 * Today a schema is one `constraints` object plus a hand-written `DBSchema`
 * type, and everything that references a table (indexes, foreign keys, query
 * columns) does so by string. Typos surface at sync time, or not at all.
 *
 * Here a table is a value carrying its own name and columns, so `indexes.ts`
 * and `foreign.ts` can import it, rename-symbol works across files, and an
 * identifier reaching SQL is one the framework constructed rather than one a
 * caller typed.
 *
 * The column descriptors are unchanged: the `Field` builders and the
 * `ExtractTableTypes` mapping are reused as-is, so this is a restructuring of
 * how tables are *declared*, not of how their types are computed. That is what
 * keeps `DB.table('users')` autocompleting exactly as it does now: the derived
 * `DBSchema` has the same shape the hand-written one had.
