 * Every driver name the ORM knows, as an interface so a third-party adapter can
 * add its own.
 *
 * A union type cannot be extended from outside the package, and widening it to
 * `string` would give up every place the compiler currently catches a typo, so
 * this is an interface and a new name arrives by declaration merging, the same
 * mechanism `DBSchema` already uses for an app's tables:
 *
 * ```ts no-check: a third-party package's own declaration file
 * declare module 'bakery-orm/adapters' {
 *   interface DriverRegistry {
 *     mssql: true
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * `bakery-orm/adapters` (the public subpath), and not this file, which is
 * private and does not resolve from outside the package. The merge reaches
 * through the barrel's `export *`; aiming it at an unresolvable specifier
 * instead declares a second, unrelated interface and leaves every driver name
 * rejected with nothing pointing at the cause.
 *
 * The value type is `true` and carries nothing: only the *keys* are read. It
 * is a set spelled as an interface, because interfaces are what TypeScript
 * lets you merge into.
