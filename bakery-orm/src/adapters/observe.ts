/**
 * Query observability: one callback, called once per executed statement.
 *
 * Deliberately **not** an emitter and **not** a listener array. This sits in
 * the hot path of every statement the ORM runs, so the cost of having the
 * feature at all has to be a single null read when nobody is watching. See
 * `observe()` below, which returns the driver's own value untouched in that
 * case. An emitter would allocate an event object and walk a list per query
 * whether or not anything subscribed.
 *
 * Process-wide rather than per-adapter, on purpose. Every adapter builds a
 * *new* adapter instance per transaction (`SQLiteAdapter.transaction` wraps the
 * transaction handle in a fresh `SQLiteAdapter`), so a hook attached to one
 * instance would go silent for exactly the statements a slow-query panel most
 * wants to see. `driver` is on the event instead, so a process talking to two
 * databases can still tell them apart.

 *   That includes whatever the consumer did between yields, so an `iterate`
 *   event is not comparable with an `all` event and must not be averaged into
 *   the same "query time" number. It is still the useful measure: for a stream,
 *   the interesting quantity is how long the statement held a cursor open.
 * - `rows` counts rows **consumed**, not rows matched. A consumer that breaks
 *   after ten rows of a million-row scan reports ten.
 * - Exactly one event, emitted from `finally`, so an early `break` (which
 *   resumes the generator with a return completion, skipping `catch`) still
