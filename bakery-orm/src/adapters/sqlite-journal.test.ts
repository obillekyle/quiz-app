/**
 * The journal mode used to be picked by platform (`DELETE` on win32, `WAL`
 * everywhere else) for a reason nobody wrote down. It is now an attempt with
 * a checked fallback, and this is the end-to-end proof of the attempt half:
 * an ordinary file-backed database runs WAL.
 *
 * On win32 this test fails against the rule it replaces, which is the point.
 * The refusal half is pinned in core's `journal-mode.test.ts`, where the
 * function is reachable directly and a database that genuinely refuses WAL
 * can be handed to it.
