 * `transaction` died on Bun's own refusal: `cannot call begin inside a
 * transaction use savepoint() instead`, identical wording on all three servers.
 * That is not an exotic shape: it is any two transactional functions calling
 * each other.
 *
 * The first test here is the crash. The ones after it are the reason savepoints
 * are the right fix rather than "silently reuse the outer transaction", which
 * would also stop the crash while quietly making an inner rollback tear down
 * work the outer had already done and meant to keep.
 *
 * Live servers are gated per dialect; without a URL those report skipped, and a
 * skip is not a pass.

/**
 * Await `promise` with an unrelated timer pending, and never remove this

 *
 * Bun 1.3.14's MySQL driver does not resume the *first query issued after a
 * transaction* unless the event loop has other work pending. Not slow:
 * indefinite: a bare `await db.query(…).all()` after `await db.transaction(…)`
 * never settles and no per-test timeout fires, so `bun test` sits there until
 * something kills it. A single unrelated `setTimeout` is enough to unwedge it.
 *
 * Two things established before this went in. It is **not** caused by
 * savepoints (the minimal reproduction is a plain non-nested transaction),  * and it is **not** caused by the change this file tests: the same reproduction
 * hangs identically against the adapters at HEAD.
 *
 * It has never been seen outside a test because a server always has pending
 * work; a test process that has just awaited its last statement has none.
 * That also makes it a harness workaround rather than a weakened assertion:
 * every expectation below is still checked against a live server.
