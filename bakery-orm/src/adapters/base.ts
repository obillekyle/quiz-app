 * more, no `Symbol.asyncIterator`, no `Symbol.iterator`, and its own methods
 * (`raw`, `simple`, `values`, `execute`, `run`) all resolve the whole result.
 * The adapters used to hand their raw query object to `for await`, which is why
 * `iterate` threw `… .iterate is not a function` on **every** dialect and why
 * `QBExecutable.iterable()` had never once worked.
 *
 * So this pages instead: the caller's statement becomes a derived table and the
 * generator walks it a window at a time.
 *
 * ```sql
 * SELECT * FROM (<the caller's SELECT>) AS bakery_stream LIMIT ? OFFSET ?
 * ```
 *
 * Verified on all three dialects against live servers, including a statement
 * that already carries its own `ORDER BY` or `LIMIT`: the derived table
 * contains it, so the window composes rather than colliding. MySQL needs the
 * alias; the other two tolerate it.
 *
 * **What this is not.** It is not a server-side cursor, and the difference is
 * observable, so say it plainly: the statement is re-executed once per chunk,
 * and chunk boundaries are only stable under a total order. Rows inserted or
 * deleted mid-walk can therefore be seen twice or missed: the same hazard
 * offset pagination has, and exactly what `seek()` exists to avoid. What it
 * does buy is the thing people reach for streaming to get: memory bounded by
 * the chunk instead of by the result.
 *
 * **What it costs, and why it is not one number.** The statement is
 * re-executed per chunk, so the total is the chunk count times whatever one
 * window costs, and what one window costs depends entirely on whether the
 * ordering can be served from an index. If it cannot, every chunk sorts the
 * whole result and throws away the offset, which is quadratic in the chunk
 * count. Measured on 100,000 rows, a chunk size of 500, so 200 statements:
 *
 *     sqlite    ORDER BY the primary key     all 180 ms   iterate    593 ms     3x
 *     sqlite    ORDER BY an unindexed column all 275 ms   iterate 35,687 ms   130x
 *     postgres  ORDER BY the primary key     all  83 ms   iterate  1,590 ms    19x
 *     postgres  ORDER BY an unindexed column all 126 ms   iterate 12,767 ms   101x
 *
 * Thirty-five seconds to walk what `all()` returns in 275 ms. The backlog
 * recorded a flat "393x", which is the right neighborhood for the unindexed
 * case and says nothing about the case a caller can fix: **order by something
 * indexed and the cost collapses by 40x.**
 *
 * The two dialects differ for different reasons. Postgres pays a network round
 * trip per chunk, which is why its indexed case is 19x where SQLite's is 3x.
 * SQLite pays nothing for the trip and everything for the sort, which is why
 * its unindexed case is the worst of the four.
 *
 * So: reach for this when the result does not fit in memory, not when it is
 * merely large. If it fits, `all()` is between 3 and 130 times faster. If it
 * does not, index the column you order by, and prefer `seek()` where the shape
 * allows it: that is keyset pagination and it has neither the cost nor the
 * skipped-row hazard described above.
