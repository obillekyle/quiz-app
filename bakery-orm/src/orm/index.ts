/**
 * **Import order is load-bearing here, and alphabetical order is wrong.**
 *
 * `query.ts` and `mutation.ts` are a cycle: `query.ts` ends with
 * `export const Insert = Mutation.Insert`, read at module top level, and
 * `mutation.ts` imports `DB` from `query.ts`. Whichever this barrel names first
 * is the one that evaluates first.
 *
 * `./query` first works. `./mutation` first does not: `mutation.ts` pulls in
 * `query.ts`, whose top-level `Mutation.Insert` runs while `Mutation` is still
 * initializing, and the whole ORM dies with
 * `TypeError: undefined is not an object (evaluating 'Mutation.Insert')`.
 *
 * Biome's `organizeImports` sorts these alphabetically and puts `./mutation`
 * first. The compiler cannot see the breakage, because the types are fine
 * either way. Hence the suppression.
