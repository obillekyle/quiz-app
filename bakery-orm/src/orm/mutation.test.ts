/**
 * The *declared* overload is pre-existing debt rather than anything this fix
 * introduces: `QB.where` types its column as `WhereColumn`, which includes
 * `QBRaw | QBObject`, while Update's and Delete's overloads narrow it to a
 * column string. Runtime accepts all three on all of them. Widening six
 * mutation signatures is a public-surface change belonging to the tracked "ORM
 * fluent-API typing gap", so the form is cast at the call site here:
 * deliberately, rather than `@ts-nocheck`-ing the file, which is what
 * `orm.test.ts` does and which would also stop checking the assertions that
 * matter.

const clause = (builder: unknown): any => builder

/**
 * `parseWhereArgs` emits `operator: ''` for the one-argument form,
 * `where(<anything exposing .parse()>)`, which is what `DB.raw` and a subquery
 * builder both are. Such a clause has no right operand, so it must render as
 * the left operand alone.
 *
 * `QB`'s `formatClause` (query.ts) and `UpdateExecutable.evalWhere` both branch
 * on it. `DeleteExecutable.evalWhere` was a copy of the Update one that never
 * received that branch, so it appended an operator that is the empty string and
 * a right operand that is `undefined`, and `evalOperands(undefined)` does not
 * throw, it *binds*: the statement gained a trailing `?` with no operator in
 * front of it and the parameter list gained an `undefined` at a position the
 * visible query does not account for.
 *
 * Reachable straight through the public API: `DB.raw` is exported, `DB.Delete`
 * is exported, and both `where()` implementations take `(column: any,
 * valueOrRef?: any)` and hand it to `parseWhereArgs` unchanged.
