/**
 * Type-level extension point connecting the framework to the app's schema.
 *
 * The dependency must point one way: the app depends on the framework, never
 * the reverse. Yet the ORM's types are derived from the app's `schema.ts`:
 * previously via a direct `import ... from '~/schema'`, which meant the
 * framework's own types imported an app-owned, gitignored file, and a fresh
 * clone could not typecheck its database layer.
 *
 * Instead, the app *registers* its schema here through declaration merging
 * (the same pattern TanStack Router and vue-router use). At the bottom of
 * `schema.ts`:
 *
 * ```ts
 * declare module 'bakery-orm/schema-registry' {
 *   interface SchemaRegistry {
 *     schema: {
 *       DBSchema: MyDBSchema
 *       DBOptionals: MyDBOptionals
 *       Views: DBInfo.Views
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * With no registration, every table and column falls back to permissive
 * `any`-shaped records. The ORM stays fully usable, just untyped. The
 * runtime needs no registration at all: schema *values* are loaded by path
 * (see `sync/load.ts`), from `schema` in `server.config.ts` when the app sets
 * one and otherwise from `<cwd>/orm/index.ts` or `<cwd>/schema.ts`, whichever
 * exists. Absence is tolerated; only a *configured* path that does not exist
 * is an error.

// Augmented by the app; empty until then.
//
// **`interface`, not `type`, and the empty body is the point.** A type alias
// cannot be declaration-merged, so rewriting this to `type X = {}` turns every
// app's `declare module 'bakery-orm/schema-registry'` into
// `TS2300: Duplicate identifier` and the whole schema registry stops working.
//
// Biome's `noBannedTypes` proposes exactly that rewrite and calls it a safe
// fix. That rule is off repo-wide now, but `noEmptyInterface` reaches the same
// construct and offers the same fix, so the suppression stays. The compiler is
// the real guard: change this line and `apps/starter` fails to typecheck.
// biome-ignore lint/suspicious/noEmptyInterface: must stay mergeable, above
