/**
 * Drop `bakery_*` fixtures a killed run left on the shared servers, once,
 * before any test file loads.
 *
 * Wired as `bun test --preload` rather than into a `beforeAll`, because there
 * is no shared setup to hang it on: the eight live test files construct their
 * adapters inline, at 31 separate sites. A preload is one wiring point and it
 * is guaranteed to run first, which is the property that matters: the damage
 * has to be repaired *before* anything reads the catalog.
 *
 * Silent when there is nothing to do, which is almost always. It prints only
 * when it actually dropped something, because that is a fact about a previous
 * run that somebody should see rather than a status line nobody reads.
 *
 * Never fails the suite. A server that is down is the ordinary state here ( * they are portable binaries that nothing starts at boot), and the live tests
 * already report as skipped in that case. Turning "Postgres is not running"
 * into a suite error would be a worse trade than leaving a sweep undone.
