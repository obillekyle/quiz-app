/**
 * The extension point, exercised the way a third-party package would use it.
 *
 * Without this the tests below do not compile: `registerAdapter({driver:
 * 'mssql'})` is a type error, because `Driver` is `keyof DriverRegistry` and
 * nothing had declared `mssql`. That is the design working: a driver name is
 * checked, and adding one is a declaration rather than a string.
 *
 * `'./adapters'` is the *barrel*, which is `'bakery-orm/adapters'` from
 * outside, and it merges even though `DriverRegistry` is declared a file
 * deeper, behind an `export *`. That is worth stating because the alternative
 * is silent: an augmentation aimed at a module the consumer cannot resolve
 * declares a second, unrelated interface and every driver name goes on being
 * rejected with no clue as to why. Both directions are asserted: `oracle`,
 * which nothing declares, is still a type error here.
